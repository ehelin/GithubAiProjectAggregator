    "summary": "### \ud83d\udd04 Pull Request Summary\n\n**1. \ud83c\udfaf Purpose of Changes**\n- The purpose of this series of changes includes replacing outdated Medium links with current ones provided by Software Mansion, enhancing testing coverage for styles with zero length, renaming `<Suspense unstable_expectedLoadTime>` to `<Suspense defer>` along with its implementation in Server Side Rendering (SSR), preventing validation during effect cleanup functions that depend on localized state derived values, optimizing the Dangerfile for improved performance, cleaning up redundant code in RootLayout and Page components, addressing a BigInt serialization issue in the development environment, and improving safety in DOM manipulation through more robust handling of segment completions.\n\n**2. \ud83d\udee0 Key Technical Changes**\n- Updating external resource references (Medium links).\n- Adding new test cases for CSS property checks.\n- Refactoring Suspense component names and their usage in SSR.\n- Enhancing dependency injection security within effect lifecycle hooks.\n- Performance optimization in configuration management tools like Dangerfile.\n- Codebase cleanup for better readability and maintenance.\n- Resolving BigInt related issues for smoother dev experience.\n- Safeguarding against unsafe operations in DOM manipulation methods.\n\n**3. \u26a0 Risks or Breaking Changes**\n- Renaming Suspense components might require updates in places where it was previously used without causing immediate disruption due to backward compatibility considerations.\n- Modifying existing tests could potentially affect other parts of the system if dependencies were not properly isolated.\n- Cleaning up code may temporarily obscure functionality until thoroughly tested.\n- Addressing BigInt serialization issues must be done carefully to avoid introducing inconsistencies"
