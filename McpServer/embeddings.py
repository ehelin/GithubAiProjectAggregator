# 3. embeddings.py
# Role: Wraps the bge-m3 embeddings model.
# What it does:
#   Loads bge-m3.
#   Provides a function like embed_text(text: str) -> list[float].
#   Used for clustering repos, comparing similarity, detecting trends.
# Think of it like: the “vectorizer” service in a RAG pipeline.

# Example high-level logic:
# def embed_text(text: str) -> list[float]:
#     return bge_model.encode(text)

# 🧩 What is embeddings.py?

# It’s a translator.

# You give it words (like a repo description, README, commit message).

# It turns those words into numbers — a long list of floats (an array).

# Those numbers capture meaning in a way computers can compare.
